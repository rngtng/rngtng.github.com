Here are two \*very\* good update-to-date sources of [Rspec](http://rspec.info/) howtos and best practices:

The first on by Andrea Reginato(@lelylan) gives a very good overview. Start here:

The second one by Jeff Pollard features ninja-kick-ass shared spec examples:

Andrea did already a good job with the Google Doc, but what about collection all tipps into git repo so everyone can easily collaborate - let's fork, PR and drive it forward!

More sources to follow - spec it, run it, kick it!
