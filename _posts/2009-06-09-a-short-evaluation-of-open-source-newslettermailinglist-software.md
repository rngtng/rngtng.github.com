A friend of mine asked me which newsletter system to use for sending abt 2k emails abt once a week. I couldn&#8217;t immediately respond, so I gave it a small evaluation of current products. As prerequisite, the system should be in active development, run on a (web)server, easy to use (usability over features) and it would be nice to use it at lowcost or for free. This limited the selection a lot and I just want to present my final opinion:

My favorite and &#8216;winner&#8217; is the **NotOneBit.com Simple Mailing List**. It&#8217;s written in PHP, simple, clean and really easy to use. Perfect for a small use-case like this. Check it out: <http://www.notonebit.com/projects/mailing-list/>

Actually I thought [PHPlist](http://www.phplist.com/details) is first choice, but I didn&#8217;t liked it usability at all &#8211; I wonder why it&#8217;s so popular?

[OpenEMM](http://www.openemm.org/) has a nice website and pretends to be opensource, but somehow I wasn&#8217;t able to get a proper version to run and test. <del datetime="2009-08-13T09:51:11+00:00">Looks more like fake to me&#8230;</del> **Update:** see comments, apparently there&#8217;s lot&#8217;s of work going on and you can download it from sourceforge easily..

[MailMan](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html) is quite popular, known as stable and high performant, but still I don&#8217;t like the backend. The whole software looks a bit outdated to me&#8230; c&#8217;mon it&#8217;s 2009!!!

Other systems may worth a look as not for free, so I didn&#8217;t test them:

<http://www.supermailer.de/>  
<http://www.campaignmonitor.com/>
