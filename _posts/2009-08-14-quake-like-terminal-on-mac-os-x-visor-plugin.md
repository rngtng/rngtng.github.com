Sure you do remember Quake. And sure you di remember how cool the console faded / slided in from the top? Image this would be available for your Mac OS X Console/Terminal. Well now _(actually since ages, but I just forgot to mention ðŸ˜‰_ it is. As small SIMBL plugin called **Visor** Plugin allows to to bring up the Terminal via a hotkey in anytime. I really love it and can&#8217;t without it anymore.
