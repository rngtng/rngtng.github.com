![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_LqGloMJUekI/SAYrvuuEVyI/AAAAAAAAAAc/eorl_nD-4EM/s200/mac-gpg-logo.png)Ok, I finally managed to set up my GPG Mail System. Thanks to the latest version of [GPGMail](http://twitter.com/humpaaa/status/6081240084) and gpg (1.4.10) (via macports `sudo port install gnupg`) it's running fine and smooth again with Snow Leopard and Mail.app. Perfect!

See [MacGPG](http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/) and [GPGMail](http://www.sente.ch/software/GPGMail/English.lproj/GPGMail.html) for more...

**UPDATE:** btw. to get GPGP work with gmail, check out [FireGPG](http://getfiregpg.org), a nice plugin for Firefox, which works perfect for me on Mac OS X. Unfortunately I haven't found any Safari solution yet...
