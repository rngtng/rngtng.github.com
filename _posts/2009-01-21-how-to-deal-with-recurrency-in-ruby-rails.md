I did a short eval of projects dealing with re currency in Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Here a short list & rough of interesting projects dealing with repeating time (intervals):

**Common used lilbrary:** <http://runt.rubyforge.org>  
**A better runt(?):** <http://github.com/nickstenning/recurring_event>  
**Date extension, yahoo dev, rspec like:** <http://github.com/jhubert/ruby-date-recur>

<http://recurring.rubyforge.org>  
<http://github.com/EdvardM/recurrence>  
<http://github.com/fnando/recurrence>
