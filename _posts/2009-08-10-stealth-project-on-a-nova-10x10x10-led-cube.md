Hey guys, look at this: I just found this awesome project by [Squidsoup](http://www.squidsoup.org/). They put up a 10x10x10 LED Cube _"NOVA 3D LED"_ (yes, 3 dimensions, yes that's 1000 single controlled LEDs) and created cool stuff like webcam projection or a the **"Stealth Project"** , a game similar to Battleships. Just get it's great sounds and projections:
