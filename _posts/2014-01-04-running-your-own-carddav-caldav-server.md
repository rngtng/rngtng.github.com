For years I've been running my own CalDav/CardDav server to sync my Contacts, Calendars and Reminders across all my devices. I've been very happy with DAViCal, until recently, I had to switch to a simple vhost which doesn't offer PostgreSQL and custom apache cfgs. So I did some research which other implementations may be useful, those are most promising ones:

**Radicale (Python + Mysql)**  
<http://radicale.org>

**Ba√Økal (PHP + Mysql)**  
based on SabreDav  
<http://baikal-server.com>

**SabreDav (PHP + Mysql)**  
DAV Framework,  
<https://code.google.com/p/sabredav>

**DAViCal (PHP + PostgreSQL)**  
Very complete, but not that easy to install.  
<http://www.davical.org>

**Other:**  
Apple CalendarServer: <http://trac.calendarserver.org>
