Hello Tobi,

My name is Tomer Danon, and I’ve been spending some time looking at your site, <http://www.rngtng.com/.> I noticed you link out to several great datasheet sites, so I thought I would let you know about my site, www.datasheets360.com.  
The site has 70 million electronic components, each with its PDF datasheet. We’re working on scaling the site up to 350 million parts (We should be up to about 180 million this summer).  
My site has inventory and pricing from many of the top distributors. It also features a part number search that I believe is better than <http://octopart.com/.>  
Please take a look at my site and add it to your resource section if you’d like. Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I can be reached via email at Tomer.Danon@ihs.com

Thank you!

Tomer Danon
