I had the problem of my Mac not going into sleep when external screen is connected and closing the lid. Luckly I came [across this advice](https://discussions.apple.com/message/19264651#19264651) which indeed, did the trick:

1. Disable external Monitor  
2. Type `sudo nvram boot-args="iog=0x0"`  
3. and restart

Voil√†!

**Update** : With Yosemite you need to type:

`sudo nvram boot-args="niog=1"`
