Some while ago I bought this nice Midi Controller [BCD3000 by Behringer](http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/BCD3000.aspx). It's an easy to use device which brings way more fun mixing your MP3. For easy party playing mode I very like [Djay](http://www.djay-software.com/), which is a simple but very powerfull mixing software. It now support Midi devices as well!  
Unfortunately I couldn't find any predefined Midi Mappings for Djay and BCD3000. So I created my own. [Please download the file here](http://github.com/downloads/rngtng/BCD3000.djayMidiMapping/BCD3000.djayMidiMapping). For now, all basic features are mapped, I may add sophisticated ones soon. It's hosted on github, so please [fork it and add you changes](http://github.com/rngtng/BCD3000.djayMidiMapping).

Happy DJing!
