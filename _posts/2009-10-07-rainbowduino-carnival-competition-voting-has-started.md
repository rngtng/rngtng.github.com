As mentioned in earlier post, I submitted the first public version of mtXcontrol to the [Rainbowduino Carnival Competition](http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=11) by Seeedstudio. Now it's time to vote for the best projects:

[![Express your opinion!](http://www.yourfreepoll.com/images/mvexghzb.gif)](http://www.yourfreepoll.com/mvexghzbsp.html)

I know, the decision will be quite hard, as a lot of other cool projects were submitted as well. Like this cool [Daft Punk Helmet](http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=440) or this nice [lipsync speaking Robot](http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=434)...

Please check out the [Raindrop Rainbowduino Game](http://vimeo.com/groups/24917/videos/6916458) by my friend ccb23 as well. It's a Rainbowduino connected via I2C to an Arduino with an Accelerometer. With that you can move the red dot on the Matrix and avoid hitting the falling blue raindrops. nice!
