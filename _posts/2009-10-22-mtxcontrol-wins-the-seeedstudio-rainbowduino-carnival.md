Yay - the voting for the [Seeedstudio Rainbowduino Carnival Competition](http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=11) is over. And, guess what, my project [mtXcontrol](http://www.rngtng.com/mtXcontrol) made the run - I won the first price! Yipheee.. that's 12x Rainbowduinos + 100$ Shopping voucher which I'll invest in buying Xbee Stuff.. Can't wait to get my hands on! Stay tuned...

Thanks to everybody voting for my project!

Btw. I just released the latest version 1.02 with some bugfixes and new features in the API...
