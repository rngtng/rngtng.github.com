  content: Hello - unrelated but about your SoundCloud in gmail embed app - I have
    installed the app but can't seem to find any instructions on how to use it? I
    want to embed a Soundcloud widget into an gmail message. Can you talk me through
    the process? Thank you! Stuart

<p>Here a very late shout out to an interesting project: control your Arduino via the browser! Basically its a browser plugin to get access to your machines (virtual) serial port. With that you can use javascript to send and receive any data - how cool is that!?</p>
