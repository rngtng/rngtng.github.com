<p>As contribution for <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=397">Seeedstudio Carnival</a>&nbsp;I'm proud to release the version&nbsp;&nbsp;1.0 of <strong>mtXcontrol</strong> today. It's feature list extended quite a lot, beside new frame&nbsp;editing features like Frame moving and Copy &amp; Paste, it now comes with Letter / Number placer to easily draw characters. Additional the frame preview bar makes it easily to navigate between the frames. As of this, it was time to get an proper UI with lot's of buttons for those who couldn't remember all those keyboard shortcuts (like me ;-))</p>
<p>So check out this Demo:</p>
