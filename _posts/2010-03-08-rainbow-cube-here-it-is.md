Yay, I finally got my [Rainbow Cube](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/rainbow-cube-kit-rgb-4x4x4-rainbowduino-compatible-p-596.html?cPath=71&zenid=6f5af82edb45a559db6dd5e4531b5faf) from Seeedstudio. It came in various parts which required happy soldering. Now, I can start experimenting and porting mtXcontrol to support Rainbow Cube as well - stay tuned!
