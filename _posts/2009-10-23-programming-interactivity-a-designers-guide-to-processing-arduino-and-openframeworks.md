![](http://image.ebook30.com/data_images/2009/07/24/1248467706-000e62d4medium.jpeg)I just stumbled upon this interesting sounding book by Joshua Noble:

[**Programming Interactivity: A Designer's Guide to Processing, Arduino, and openFrameworks**](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596154158).

A few of the topics covered: Basic C, Processing, openFrameworks, Gesture and touch recognition, Motors and Servos, LEDs and LCDs, LilyPad and many more! - Wow, that's sounds promising - wanna have!
