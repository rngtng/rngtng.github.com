If Samuel just would have asked me, I got an answer:

Oldies, but Goldies: 'Methodfinder' is a really nice extension for your ruby/rails irb and shipped with the 'what_methods' gem. I'm using quite a lot and can't go without it anymore (aka. I'm too stupid to remember all those method names ;-).

`gem install what_methods`
