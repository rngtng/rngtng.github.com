<p>As mentioned in earlier post, I submitted the first public version of mtXcontrol  to the <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=11">Rainbowduino Carnival Competition</a> by Seeedstudio. Now it's time to vote for the best projects:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yourfreepoll.com/mvexghzbsp.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.yourfreepoll.com/images/mvexghzb.gif" alt="Express your opinion!" border="0"></a></p>
<p>I know,  the decision will be quite hard, as a lot of other cool projects were submitted as well. Like this cool <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=440">Daft Punk Helmet</a>  or this nice <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=434">lipsync speaking Robot</a>... </p>
<p>Please check out the <a href="http://vimeo.com/groups/24917/videos/6916458">Raindrop Rainbowduino Game</a> by my friend ccb23 as well. It's a Rainbowduino connected via I2C to an Arduino with an Accelerometer. With that you can move the red dot on the Matrix and avoid hitting the falling blue raindrops. nice!</p>
