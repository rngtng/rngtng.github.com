Here's another little AppleScript I recently wrote:

**DelJect** - an AppleScript to delete and eject any external Cards/USB Stick

A friend asked for this little script: His problem was, that his photography camera couldn't deal with apple's hidden files like`.DS_STORE`&nbsp;etc. To workaorund that, he had to delete those files each time before ejecting. DelJect automates this manual process. Voila!

Download the latest version here:&nbsp;[DelJect.app](https://github.com/downloads/rngtng/DelJect/DelJect.dmg)

**Usage**  
Just run the binary, select the device (USB stick), confirm delete and unplug the stick. Done!

As a litte gotcha, DelJect will remeber the device - so next time, just confirm & go.

Thanks to&nbsp;[Niels](http://leuchtstoffk.de/)&nbsp;for the idea and thanks&nbsp;[Icon-Land](http://www.veryicon.com/icons/media/play-stop-pause/eject-normal-red.html)&nbsp;for Icon.
