  content: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm the system engineer in IteadStudio.  We just punish a device
    called \"Colorduino\" as \"Rainbowduino\" for Seeedstudio. The Colorduino is powerful
    than Rainbowduino for hardware PWM and supporting 16M true colors. The introduce
    is http://iteadstudio.com/product/ah-colorduino-debut/\r\n\r\nWe want to transplant
    the mtXControl to Colorduino, but now we have a problem. We have a test that is
    after I uploaded the firmware to Arduino(in Atmega328), and connected to the USB-To-UART
    \ device to my PC, the mtXControl display that \"Not output device found\"  and
    the button \"Device:SLAVE\" is disable. While we sample the UART signal by Logic
    Analyzer, we have not found any signal sent from PC or Arduino.\r\n\r\nCould you
    give me a message that what number of serial port is the mtXControl used? And
    the Baudrate and other serial communication detail for mtXControl? \r\n\r\nBest
    Regard\r\nzzy@iteadstudio.com"
