    think some of the color constants might be off - some yellows are red, and vice
    versa. I'll take a look at the source soon. Thank you for the library!!\r\n\r\n-Justin"

  content: "Hi, very nice library you got there, i will use it for a project, thank
    you very much. I have a couple of questions though: \r\n\r\n*Can I use your library
    to just read the current button states? i mean polling the launchpad to see what
    color is some button currently in, for instance?\r\n\r\n*Dou you know if it's
    even possible to use the Launchpad with the Ableton Software WHILE AT THE SAME
    TIME use your library to do some other stuff?\r\n\r\nWhen I'm done with my project
    I'll send you a video and of course put you in the credits :)\r\n\r\nThx!"

  content: I'd love to use this library, but I have a Launchpad S and it refuses to
    find the midi device. I really hope this gets updated to use any launchpad model.
    I can't figure out how to change the java source myself.

<p>The <a href="http://www.novationmusic.com/products/launchpad">Novation's launchpad</a> is a 8x8 RG LED MIDI controller similar to the <a href="http://monome.org/">Monome</a>. In addition, it has 8 Button on the top and 8 Scene Button on the left. Originally meant as MIDI Controller its bundled with Ableton Live to pimp your DJ Sets and Tunes. All over it's a wonderful device, not only for your music, but for doing some LED ouput &amp; input hacking.</p>
<p>Thomas Jachmanns released a <a href="http://github.com/thomasjachmann/launchpad">ruby library gem</a> quite soon after the device was released. But by now, I couldn't find any Processing/Java support, so it's was time to create a proper wrapper library... and here it is!</p>
<p>The library provides an interface to access novation's launchpad programmatically and is heavily based on ruby launchpad gem which you can see by it's similar APIs. LEDs can be lighted and button presses can be listened to.</p>
<p>In addition, it includes a wrapper for the Monomic Library, so you can port all Monome Processing code to Launchpad easily!</p>
<p>It's <a href="http://rngtng.github.com/launchpad/">project page</a> and  its <a href="http://github.com/rngtng/launchpad">source</a> is hosted on github. Please feel free to use it for your proposes and  fork and improve the source!<br />

<p>more Video examples comming soon!</p>
