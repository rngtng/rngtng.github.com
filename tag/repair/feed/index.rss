<p>Since a very long time, I had my old 4th Generation iPod laying around. With iPhone, SoundCloud &amp; Co, I hadn&#8217;t had any use for it &#8211; until now: my Camping Van came &#8216;only&#8217; with a CD Radio and an Aux-In &#8211; which is perfect for my Ipod. If it would only work. Battery was down, and even worse &#8211; the Harddisk crashed. But a quick google made me hope: there&#8217;s indeed a chance to replace the HD with Flash memory. Faster, cheeper and less power consumption. I had to try it.<br />
So I followed those super easy steps Eddie posted on instructables:</p>
<p>http://www.instructables.com/id/Convert-your-4th-Gen-iPod-to-use-Flash-Memory</p>
<p>Main trick is to get a &#8216;IDE 50 Pin Male zu CF Compact Flash Female Adapter&#8217; &#8211; on ebay or similar for just 5 EURs. Compact Flash memory you get for abt. 1EUR per GB, which int total, made the 40GB replacement quite cheap. It just took me minutes to replace the harddrive, including a new Battery. Now my more than 10 years(!!) old iPod works better like never before! Amazing.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking!</p>
<p>UPDATE: make sure you check DIAG-Mode and HW-Reset too:</p>
<p><em>First what I would do is wait for it to reboot itself and as soon as the screen turns off begin holding the Center + Play/Pause buttons until Your iPod Enters Disk Mode and THEN plug it into your iMac and select &#8220;Restore&#8221;. =) Also when you get the chance, Hold Menu + Center and as soon as the screen goes out, Hold Center + Previous/Rewind. You will get a White Screen, select &#8220;Manual Test&#8221; and then go to &#8220;IO&#8221; then &#8220;Hard Drive&#8221; and then select Hard Drive Smart Data and type every character on that screen up here, I will be able to tell you if your iPod&#8217;s internal hard disk is going bad</em></p>
