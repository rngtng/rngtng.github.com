    extension to the previous version, see my discussion thread for details.

<p>Yeah <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/140568/2009/05/osx_update.html">Mac Os X 10.5.7</a> just got released. All fine for me, except my external USB soundcard <strong>Terratec Aureon 5.1</strong> can't be volume controlled anymore - strange!? Any idea what's wrong?</p>
<p>[update - solved!]<br />
Apparently downgrading the USB Sound kernel back to 10.5.6 Version solves the issue. See the comments and the  <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=9466757&amp;#9466757">Apple Discussion-board</a> for more... Thx to <em>sonderpop</em> for that hint!</p>
