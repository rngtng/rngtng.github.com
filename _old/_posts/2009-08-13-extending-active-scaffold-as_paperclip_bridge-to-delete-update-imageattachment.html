<p>As you know I'm quite fond of working with <a href="http://activescaffold.com/">Active Scaffold (AS)</a> for data administration proposes. Quite recently we moved over to the RoR <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/paperclip">paperclip attachment plugin</a> for file upload handling. I was even more happy to see a Active Scaffold bridge which integrates paperclip smoothly into AS as well. It's created by and hosted <a href="http://github.com/mnaglik/as_paperclip_bridge/tree/master">here</a> on github.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it didn't provide the possibility to delete or update an image once it's assigned to an object. Well no problem, another fork of mine, some coding and now it possible. I basically reused to code of the as_file_column_bridge. Check it out here:<br />
