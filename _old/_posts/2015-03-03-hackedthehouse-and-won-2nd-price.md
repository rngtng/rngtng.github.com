Last weekend I attended [HackTheHouse](%20http://hackthehouse.io "HackTheHouse"){.broken_link}, a 24hrs Hackathon in Berlin, organized by [Relayr](https://relayr.io/) and [BSH](https://www.bsh-group.de/) &#8211; all in the Name of IoT. I teamed up with Chris(ccb23), Clemens and Roby from Italy. We had a blast!

We were given a couple of BSH Home appliances, Relayr WunderBars, Arduino, RaspberryPi, Seeedstudio Grove, Nest etc. &#8211; so all the Toys a hardware hacker only could think of.

Our idea was to bring FUN the to dull, boring household tasks.  We solve this problem by gamify cleaning duties &#8211; regular household tasks are turned into a big game, you score every-time you fulfill a task, as sooner and thoroughly, as more points you get.

After 24hrs we presented a first prototype &#8211; including a dishwasher, a smart trashcan and a smart broom. The jury was amazed and we scored the 2nd price!
