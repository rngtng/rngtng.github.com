<p>This time a more sophisticated example. I started to develop an LED Matrix controller and editor in <a href="http://www.processing.org">Processing</a> (like every does his first steps on arduino, I think).<br />
By now, you can create a sequence by selecting the LEDs to light up and move over to the next frame. Finished, run it on the Arduino and control the speed - a nice and quick <del datetime="2009-05-12T10:14:04+00:00">toy</del> way to create any light patterns you can think of easily. </p>

<p>More examples and source code soon to come...</p>
