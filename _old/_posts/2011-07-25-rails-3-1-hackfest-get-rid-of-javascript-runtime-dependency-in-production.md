This weekend was [Rails 3.1 Hackfest](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/7/14/rails-3-1-hackfest). The rails community was called to test the upcoming version 3.1 to its limits, to find bugs and or flaws and get it polished for the final release. So I did:

I&#8217;m working with the rails 3.1 since it first release candidate, but never tried in production. So I made my task to finally test this, and bring my app in the wild &#8211; on my (not root) server. Rails 3.0 is running there smoothly so I didn&#8217;t expect any problems &#8211; wrong!  
Show stopper was the Javascript Runtime dependency on production. Reason was quickly found: [Coffee-Script](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/){.broken_link} &#8211; ahrg! It depends on [ExecJS](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs), which depends on a Javascript Runtime. Unfortunately, and that&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not on a root server, I got neither node.js, therubyraser, Mustang nor Johnson installed there.

I read [this article](https://moocode.com/posts/1-deploying-a-rails-3-1-application-to-production){.broken_link}, which supposed to precompile the assets &#8211; didn&#8217;t help either and runtime is needed again.

In the End, the solution was as simple as obvious: just don&#8217;t use coffee-script in production ðŸ™‚ I did, removed the coffee-script gem form my Gemfile &#8211; and tatatata: it works! Uhh! This took me quite a long time to get it right. Javascript Runtime dependecy no good for prodcution, and reading [Mr. Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/2011/06/14/what-the-hell-is-happening-to-rails/) it&#8217;s looking good to get this fixed for the final release &#8211; uff! Happy so get tin final one soon! Yeah!
