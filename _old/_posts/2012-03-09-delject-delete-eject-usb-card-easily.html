<p>Here's another little AppleScript I recently wrote:</p>
<p><strong>DelJect</strong> - an AppleScript to delete and eject any external Cards/USB Stick</p>
<p>A friend asked for this little script: His problem was, that his photography camera couldn't deal with apple's hidden files like<code>.DS_STORE</code>&nbsp;etc. To workaorund that, he had to delete those files each time before ejecting. DelJect automates this manual process. Voila!</p>
<p>Download the latest version here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/downloads/rngtng/DelJect/DelJect.dmg">DelJect.app</a></p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong><br />
Just run the binary, select the device (USB stick), confirm delete and unplug the stick. Done!</p>
<p>As a litte gotcha, DelJect will remeber the device - so next time, just confirm &amp; go.</p>
<p>Thanks to&nbsp;<a href="http://leuchtstoffk.de/">Niels</a>&nbsp;for the idea and thanks&nbsp;<a href="http://www.veryicon.com/icons/media/play-stop-pause/eject-normal-red.html">Icon-Land</a>&nbsp;for Icon.</p>
