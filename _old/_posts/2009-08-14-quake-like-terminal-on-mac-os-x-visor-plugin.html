<p>Sure you do remember Quake. And sure you di remember how cool the console faded / slided in from the top? Image this would be available for your Mac OS X Console/Terminal. Well now <em>(actually since ages, but I just forgot to mention ;-)</em> it is. As small SIMBL plugin called <strong>Visor</strong> Plugin allows to to bring up the Terminal via a hotkey in anytime. I really love it and can't without it anymore.<br />
