Here&#8217;s another little AppleScript I recently wrote:

**DelJect** &#8211; an AppleScript to delete and eject any external Cards/USB Stick

A friend asked for this little script: His problem was, that his photography camera couldn&#8217;t deal with apple&#8217;s hidden files like`.DS_STORE` etc. To workaorund that, he had to delete those files each time before ejecting. DelJect automates this manual process. Voila!

Download the latest version here: [DelJect.app](https://github.com/downloads/rngtng/DelJect/DelJect.dmg)

**Usage**  
Just run the binary, select the device (USB stick), confirm delete and unplug the stick. Done!

As a litte gotcha, DelJect will remeber the device &#8211; so next time, just confirm & go.

Thanks to [Niels](http://leuchtstoffk.de/) for the idea and thanks [Icon-Land](http://www.veryicon.com/icons/media/play-stop-pause/eject-normal-red.html) for Icon.
