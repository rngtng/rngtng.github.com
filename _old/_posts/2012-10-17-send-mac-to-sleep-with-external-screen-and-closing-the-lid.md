I had the problem of my Mac not going into sleep when external screen is connected and closing the lid. Luckly I came [across this advice](https://discussions.apple.com/message/19264651#19264651) which indeed, did the trick:

1. Disable external Monitor  
2. Type \`sudo nvram boot-args=&#8221;iog=0x0&#8243;\`  
3. and restart

Voil√†!

**Update**: With Yosemite you need to type:

\`sudo nvram boot-args=&#8221;niog=1&#8243;\`
