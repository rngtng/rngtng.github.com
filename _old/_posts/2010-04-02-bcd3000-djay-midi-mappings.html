<p>Some while ago I bought this nice Midi Controller <a href="http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/BCD3000.aspx">BCD3000 by Behringer</a>. It's an easy to use device which brings way more fun mixing your MP3. For easy party playing mode I very like <a href="http://www.djay-software.com/">Djay</a>, which is a simple but very powerfull mixing software. It now support Midi devices as well!<br />
Unfortunately I couldn't find any predefined Midi Mappings for Djay and BCD3000. So I created my own. <a href="http://github.com/downloads/rngtng/BCD3000.djayMidiMapping/BCD3000.djayMidiMapping">Please download the file here</a>. For now, all basic features are mapped, I may add sophisticated ones soon. It's hosted on github, so please <a href="http://github.com/rngtng/BCD3000.djayMidiMapping">fork it and add you changes</a>.</p>
<p>Happy DJing!</p>
