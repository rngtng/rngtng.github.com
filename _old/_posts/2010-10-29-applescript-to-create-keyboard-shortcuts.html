<p>Last week my company laptop got stolen, so I had to setup my system again using this <a href="http://www.rngtng.com/2010/04/27/my-snow-leopard-development-system-ruby-rails-arduino-co/">list</a>. The positive part of each new system setup is you think more and more how to automate your setup..</p>
<p>This time I was really annoyed with setting up keyboard shortcuts, so I came up with this little AppleScript which does the work:</p>
<p>[gist id=652031 file=create_shortcuts.scpt]</p>
<p>The key is 'GUI scripting' - a specify way of AppleScript to simulate clicks, keystrokes etc. for *any* (native?) App. You only have to know the ids of the GUI elements which you can get with this very nice tool:<br />
