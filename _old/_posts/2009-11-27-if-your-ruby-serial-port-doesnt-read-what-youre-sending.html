<p>Some days ago I got my <a href="http://twitter.com/rngtng/status/5792203896">Novation</a> <a href="http://www.novationmusic.com/launchpad/">launchpad</a> an immediately started hacking with some <a href="http://github.com/thomasjachmann/launchpad">Ruby</a> and Arduino flavor. I wanted to port ccb23 <a href="http://vimeo.com/6916458">Raindrops Project</a> to launchpad. </p>
<p>For that, I needed Serial communication within ruby. Thanks to <a href="http://ruby-serialport.rubyforge.org/">ruby-serialport</a> first steps went quite well. I could write OR read from and to Arduino easily. But for some reasons, writing AND reading using the same instance didn't work out. </p>
<p>I used a simple 'send-input-back' sketch on the Arduino side. So every byte I'm sending is returned back. I checked with the Arduino IDE Serialmonitor and a simple Processing script - everything worked alright.  But using ruby it was different. Writing to serial port worked okay, but reading from it was just random. Sometimes I read the response, sometime I didn't - really, really weird. Some headaches and a lot of time testing I finally found the solution: just open two instances of the serial port. One for sending, one for reading - and, surprise, surprise - it works perfect! Who would have guessed that!? Strange.. </p>
<p>[ruby]<br />
// To be completed<br />
require 'serialport'<br />
port_write = Serialport.new()<br />
port_read = Serialport.new()<br />
[/ruby]</p>
<p>Ok, continuing hacking, more soon...</p>
