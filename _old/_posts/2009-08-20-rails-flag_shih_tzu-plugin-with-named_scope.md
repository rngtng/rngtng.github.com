When it comes to store a load of boolean data into your model you easily end up with lots of columns which blow up your table unnecessarily. The developers at [Xing](http://blog.xing.com/category/tech-blog) solved this problem with a nifty Rails Plugin called [flag\_shih\_tzu](http://github.com/xing/flag_shih_tzu/){.broken_link}. The trick is to store all boolean values combined as a bit vector, which allows you to put up to 32 values (4Byte) within a single Integer column. Automatic generated access methods allows you to deal with you model as your are used to. Wanna see an example? (Taken from plugin docs)

[ruby]  
class Spaceship < ActiveRecord::Base  
include FlagShihTzu

has_flags 1 => :warpdrive,  
2 => :shields

end

enterprise = Spaceship.new  
enterprise.warpdrive = true  
enterprise.shields = false  
enterprise.save

enterprise.warpdrive? #=> true  
enterprise.shields? # => false  
[/ruby]

Nice, isn&#8217;t it?

Unfortunately named scopes where missing for selecting models easily. So another github fork, another fix, and here were are. Now this works as well:

[ruby]  
Spaceship.flagged(:warpdrive).not_flagged(:shields).all  
[/ruby]

**Update:** replaced &#8216;routes&#8217; with &#8216;scopes&#8217; &#8211; I&#8217;m getting confused with that all the time, how come!? ðŸ˜‰
