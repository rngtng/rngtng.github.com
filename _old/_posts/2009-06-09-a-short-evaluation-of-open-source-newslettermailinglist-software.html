  content: "I was wondering what was so difficult to download OpenEMM from sourceforge
    (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openemm/files/) and install it on a web server?\r\n\r\nI
    did that a while ago and it was fairly easy to install. I wonder if this has changed
    in the last half year, because that is when I did install it on my local webserver
    to check it out (haven't sent mail with it)."

  content: OpenEMM works perfectly for me too, but the wizard to create a new mailing
    is not very userfriendly. You can easily create the mailing the "normal" way.

  content: "Hello out there\r\n\r\nIs anyone experienced with open source newsletter
    software from www.open-letters.de/opensource.html ? I am searching for an easy
    to use software too, but i do not want to use OpenEMM: Its too big, to complicated
    for me.\r\n\r\nThank You all for Your answers!\r\nPaul"

<p>A friend of mine asked me which newsletter system to use for sending abt 2k emails abt once a week. I couldn't immediately respond, so I gave it a small evaluation of current products. As prerequisite, the system should be in active development, run on a (web)server, easy to use (usability over features) and it would be nice to use it at lowcost or for free. This limited the selection a lot and I just want to present my final opinion:</p>
<p>My favorite and 'winner' is the <strong>NotOneBit.com Simple Mailing List</strong>. It's written in PHP, simple, clean and really easy to use. Perfect for a small use-case like this. Check it out: http://www.notonebit.com/projects/mailing-list/</p>
<p>Actually I thought <a href="http://www.phplist.com/details">PHPlist </a>is first choice, but I didn't liked it usability at all - I wonder why it's so popular?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openemm.org/">OpenEMM</a> has a nice website and pretends to be opensource, but somehow I wasn't able to get a proper version to run and test. <del datetime="2009-08-13T09:51:11+00:00">Looks more like fake to me...</del> <strong>Update:</strong> see comments, apparently there's lot's of work going on and you can download it from sourceforge easily..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html">MailMan</a> is quite popular, known as stable and high performant, but still I don't like the backend. The whole software looks a bit outdated to me... c'mon it's 2009!!!</p>
<p>Other systems may worth a look as not for free, so I didn't test them:<br />
