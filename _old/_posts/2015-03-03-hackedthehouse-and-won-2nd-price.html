<p>Last weekend I attended&nbsp;<a title="HackTheHouse" href="http://hackthehouse.io">HackTheHouse</a>, a 24hrs Hackathon in Berlin, organized by <a href="https://relayr.io/">Relayr</a> and <a href="https://www.bsh-group.de/">BSH</a> - all in the Name of IoT. I teamed up with Chris(ccb23), Clemens and Roby from Italy. We had a blast!</p>
<p>We were given a couple of BSH Home appliances, Relayr WunderBars, Arduino, RaspberryPi, Seeedstudio Grove, Nest etc. - so all the Toys a hardware hacker only could think of.</p>
<p>Our idea was to bring FUN the&nbsp;to dull, boring household tasks. &nbsp;We solve this problem by gamify cleaning duties - regular household tasks are turned into a big game, you score every-time you fulfill a task, as sooner and&nbsp;thoroughly, as more&nbsp;points you get.</p>
<p>After 24hrs we presented a first prototype - including a dishwasher, a smart trashcan and a smart broom. The jury was amazed and we scored the 2nd price!</p>
