For the record: Here&#8217;s my favorite realworld hack I got once told by my lovley coworker Roel:

**How to clean a messy whiteboard.**

Remember the situation when one used the wrong pen for the whiteboard and can&#8217;t clean it? Just take another pen which can be erased and go over the non erasable parts &#8211; suddenly everything gets clean away:

Or in the words of TvLesson:  
_Take another dry erase marker (preferably darker than the marks that you are trying to remove) and draw on top of the messy marks. Then wipe the marks away with a dry erase eraser or soft cloth. </p> 

The new layer of dry erase marker will lift and loosen the underlying marks. It&#8217;s simple but may not work for tougher messy marks.</em>
