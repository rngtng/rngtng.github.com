I recently wrote a simple Android App which allows me to control my HarmonKardon Avr-35 stereo remotely via IR. Presenting: IrDude.

It uses the an undocumented Samsung IR API, so its unfortunately very much tight to Samsung galaxy note 10.1 tablet. Nevertheless, it does the Job for my, and is hopefully a good starting point for other to do similar. Check <http://www.remotecentral.com> to find hex codes to support other devices.
