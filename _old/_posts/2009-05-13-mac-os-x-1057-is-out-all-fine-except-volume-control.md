Yeah [Mac Os X 10.5.7](http://www.macworld.com/article/140568/2009/05/osx_update.html) just got released. All fine for me, except my external USB soundcard **Terratec Aureon 5.1** can&#8217;t be volume controlled anymore &#8211; strange!? Any idea what&#8217;s wrong?

[update &#8211; solved!]  
Apparently downgrading the USB Sound kernel back to 10.5.6 Version solves the issue. See the comments and the [Apple Discussion-board](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=9466757&#9466757){.broken_link} for more&#8230; Thx to _sonderpop_ for that hint!
