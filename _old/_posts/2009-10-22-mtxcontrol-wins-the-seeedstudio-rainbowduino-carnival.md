Yay &#8211; the voting for the [Seeedstudio Rainbowduino Carnival Competition](http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=11){.broken_link} is over. And, guess what, my project [mtXcontrol](/mtXcontrol) made the run &#8211; I won the first price! Yipheee.. that&#8217;s 12x Rainbowduinos + 100$ Shopping voucher which I&#8217;ll invest in buying Xbee Stuff.. Can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on! Stay tuned&#8230;

Thanks to everybody voting for my project!

Btw. I just released the latest version 1.02 with some bugfixes and new features in the API&#8230;
