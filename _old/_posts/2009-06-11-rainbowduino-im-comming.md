Yeah! Just ordered a bunch of stuff from the [Seeedstudio Shop](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot), my new favorite Arduino parts dealer. I&#8217;m really looking forward to get the [RainbowDuino](http://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/?page_id=187){.broken_link} into my hands. I&#8217;ve already order thier 8&#215;8 RGB LED Matrix at [ebay](http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&item=220324377200) which is really promissing&#8230; Unfortunately they are located in china to shipping takes ages ;-( More soon to come &#8230;.
