    1:1 what you're doing with mtXcontrol. Maybe I should make this the default option..\r\n\r\nah

    Start the Processing IDE and load the mtXcontrol.pde and run it. (Don't get confused,
    this will load all other files as well.) For the firmware, open Arduino IDE, load
    firmware.pde and upload it to your rainbowduino. By default, the firmware loads
    it's data from EEPROM. If you've never used it before it's likely that each byte
    has 255 as value which would result in a white screen - seems allright!"

  content: I got it working. When you open the .pde file with Processing it alerts
    you that you need to move it to it's own folder. So you have to say continue,
    and then put all of the other files besides the firmware folder inside the new
    mtxcontrol folder. Then it started working just fine! Thanks!

    will get a avrdude serial error.\r\n\r\nonce that happens you cant reprogram the

    At some point the default rainbow-pattern stopped working so I guess something
    was uploaded. Can the Rainbowduino get corrupt?\r\n\r\nI have the board \"Arduino
    Diecimila, Duemilanove, or Nano w/ ATmega168\" selected all the time.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n/Ola"

    Hi!!

    I've tried but it does not work for me... what I do is the following:
    1- Connect Arduino (328) with Rainbowduino as your connections (tx-tx, rx-rx)
    2- Upload the blank sketch to the 328 arduino
    3- Change the Board to "Arduino Diecimila, Duemilanove or nano Atmega/168" and upload the firmware.pde
    At this point, the upload is not succesful and I get the error: "avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding"

    Any idea?


    Thanks in advance,
    xphere.

Yay - I finally got my <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/?p=410">RainbowDuino</a>. Unluckily I did sth wrong with the external power connection (JST 2 pin jack) and smashed a capacitor. Maybe the polarity was wrong or it couldn't stand the 12 volts? But luckily no damage to the main system so it still works using the terminal connector (right through the 5volts of the Arduino). *phew*</p>
<p>The first real basic problem I ran into <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=328">was how to program the Rainbowduino</a> as there's no USB connector and I don't have an UART interface.<br />
<a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/?p=420">But well, nothing simpler than that:</a> Just connect your Arduino's Tx,Rx,GND,Reset and Vcc ports with those of the Rainbowduino, choose the right controller type in your IDE and program it as usual - works perfect for me!</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="http://www.rngtng.com/mtXcontrol">Rainbowduino Editor mtXcontrol here</a> - it's an easy way to draw shapes on your rainbowduino!</p>
<p>Btw. <em>DTR</em> on Rainbowduino is <em>Reset</em> on Arduino</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br />
Sorry I forgot to mention, this trick does NOT work if your host arduino is a ATmega168 - you need an ATmega328 to pass serial communication through. Before that, make sure you upload this blank sketch to your host Arduino first:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
/* blank sketch to upload on Arduino */<br />
void setup()<br />
{<br />
}</p>
<p>void loop()<br />
{<br />
}</p>
<p>[/code]</p>
<p>And, as multiple times requested, a picture of my complete setup:<br />
<img src="http://www.rngtng.com/files/2009/06/arduino_rainbowduino.jpg" alt="arduino_rainbowduino" width="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-296" /></p>
<p>Make sure you've selected the switch right. It has to point to the same side as the green Terminal connectors are. If you power rainbowduino through the white JST jack, flip it!</p>
