If Samuel just would have asked me, I got an answer:</p>
<p>Oldies, but Goldies: 'Methodfinder'  is a really nice extension for your ruby/rails irb and shipped with the 'what_methods' gem. I'm using quite a lot and can't go without it anymore (aka. I'm too stupid to remember all those method names ;-).</p>
<p><code>gem install what_methods</code></p>
