By the time I was working at Qype, I often had to deal with OAuth APIs. Doing example request works to a certain point quite good with a Plugin the for Firefox. But when it comes to Authorized or POST Request you're stuck!</p>
<p>So I developed a tiny command line client, which allows you to send request easily. It comes as a gem and easily to install:</p>
<p><code>gem install oauth-cli</code></p>
<p>After installation, execute <strong>oauthc</strong>. You either make onetime calls, with giving all required data as parameter, or just go into interactive mode, to get a shell for multiple calls and history. For not stating all connection data over and over again, it comes with multiple profile support, a wizard to create those easily and presets for <strong>Twitter and Qype</strong>.</p>
<p>See this nifty example call:<br />
<code>oauthc -p twitter get statuses/friends.json</code></p>
