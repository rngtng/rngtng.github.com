<p><a href="http://activescaffold.com/">ActiveScaffold</a> is a great plugin to build edit form easily. Nicely AJAX and nested forms support (well with limits ;-). One thing which bugged me all the time, was the extra click you had to do to show the searchbox. Well I solved it like this:</p>
<p>[ruby]<br />
  def index<br />
    active_scaffold_config.list.label += render_to_string( :action => :search, :layout => false )<br />
    super<br />
  end<br />
[/ruby]</p>
<p>I know, it's kind of bad hack, as the label actually isn't supposed to contain a form - but it works out quite well! </p>
