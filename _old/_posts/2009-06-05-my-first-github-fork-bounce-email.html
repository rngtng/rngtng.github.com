<p>Hurray! I finally forked a github project. Yesterday I ran into the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/bounce-email/">bounce-email gem</a> by Agris Ameriks on Rubyforge. It's basically a 1:1 port of the <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/2691.html">PHP Bounce Handler class</a>by Chris Fortune and not very rubyified. Thanks to David Reese, <a href="http://github.com/whatcould/bounce-email/tree/master">bounce-email is forked on github </a> and I could easily extend it.</p>
<p>I rubyfied the class, did some code cleanup, added (yet a very simple) way to get the  original message, and gained some performance by paring message only on demand. A testcase was broken as well the Rakefile, both are fixed. See the update here:<br />
