Here are two \*very\* good update-to-date sources of [Rspec](http://rspec.info/) howtos and best practices:

The first on by Andrea Reginato(@lelylan) gives a very good overview. Start here:  
<https://docs.google.com/a/soundcloud.com/document/d/1gi00-wwPaLk5VvoAJhBVNh9Htw4Rwmj-Ut88T4M2MwI/mobilebasic?pli=1&hl=en>

The second one by Jeff Pollard features ninja-kick-ass shared spec examples:  
<http://bitfluxx.com/2011/05/23/some-rspec-tips-and-best-practices.html>

Andrea did already a good job with the Google Doc, but what about collection all tipps into git repo so everyone can easily collaborate &#8211; let&#8217;s fork, PR and drive it forward!

More sources to follow &#8211; spec it, run it, kick it!
