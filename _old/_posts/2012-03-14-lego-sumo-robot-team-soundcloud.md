Uh, long, long time ago, (aka. last year autumn) I&#8217;ve been to [GoTo Conference 2011 in Ã…rhus](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011/) to present SoundCloud. For the evening program, a Lego Mindstorm Sumo fight was organized which, for sure, we couldn&#8217;t miss. Watch our sweet robot in action &#8211;  
the first round of the sumo battle, where Team SoundCloud flips over the opponent!



Unfortunately that was already it&#8217;s glorious time &#8211; we dropped out for the second round. Anyway &#8211; it was big-huge-massive fun. Make sure you grab some lego bricks and build your own. 

In case you&#8217;re interested in the code, it wasn&#8217;t much and nothing to be proud of &#8211; but worked!
