  content: "Hi Tobias,\r\n\r\nI noticed that you list companies that sell electronic
    parts/components on the menu of your site under:\r\nARDUINO &amp; CO.\r\n\r\nWe
    are a sourcing engine to help others find parts they are searching for with pricing
    who has it and how many they have in stock. One of our main goals is to stop counterfeit
    parts which we know is huge in the electronic component industry. We verify our
    suppliers so our users get quality. I believe we would be a great resource and
    addition to your site. Please add us:\r\n<a href=\"http://componentsearch.com/\"

I'm currently working on and Editor and Viewer so deal with plantuml UML diagrams nicely. PlantUML is great, but far way from a simple user experience. Instead <https://www.websequencediagrams.com> is simple, but property and not not 100% free. Vizard aims to jump in here. Designed as a client side web application based on backbone.js, it will feature a view to load existing diagrams, as well as an editor to update those.  
Storage integrations like local storage or even Github are planned. Alpha Preview: <http://vizard.io>

Soon more! Stay tuned and follow my development at <https://github.com/rngtng/vizard>

Disclaimer: vizard started as a 20% hacker project at SoundCloud.
