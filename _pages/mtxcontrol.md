    download and a little bit of source code to achive this. In detail, i did the
    following:\r\n\r\n<>\r\n\r\n- copy the folder \"source\" to  %sketchbook%\\mtXcontrol\r\n-
    remove %sketchbook%\\mtXcontrol\\*.java\r\n- create the a global library folder
    %sketchbook%\\libraries\r\n- create a folder structure like this _for_each_ library
    except serial\r\n   %sketchbook%\\libraries\\LIBRARYNAME\\library, e.g. ...libraries\\core\\library\\
    \  and move the lib-file into this folder\r\n- create the font files in processing
    -> Tools -> Create Fonts...\r\n\r\nIf the connection could be established, you
    are fine. If not, you have to change some lines in the source of mtXcontrol:\r\n\r\nchange
    \r\n\tdevice = new LaunchpadDevice(this); \r\n\tif(device == null || !device.enabled())
    device = new RainbowduinoDevice(this);\r\nto\r\n\tdevice = new RainbowduinoDevice(this,
    \"COM4\");\r\n\t\r\nusing the correct com port. That was the solution for me.\r\n\r\nBest

    at the same time so far!\r\n\r\nI am using the Uno to make the connection between
    the Arduino 0022 and the Rainbowduino. I have successfully uploaded a blank sketch
    to the arduino and the mtxcontro firmware to the rainbowduino (leds are all white).
    However, mtxcontrol is simply not communicating with the whole uno/rainbowduino
    setup. I think the problem is that the uno is communicating through Port 5 but
    the mtxcontrol (at least the version I have) seems hardwaired for Port 1. I have
    tried compiling the mtxcontrol sketch to use port 5 but I get so many compiler
    errors that are beyond my capability to deal with. Autodetect just doesn't seem
    to be working. Any help much appreciated\r\n\r\nThank You (cos I think mtxcontrol
    will be great if I can get it working!!)"

    light up when I send activity to the board, but the lights do not light up. The
    only thing I can get working with this 3.0 board is the included examples that
    come with the stock 3.0 firmware. Ideas?

    Hello everybody,
    I try to control my Colorduino with MTX Control, but it doesn't work. Is MTX Control compatible with the Colorduino?

    My Hardware:
    Colorduino V1.3 with standard LED-Matrix:http://www.lipoly.de/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=199290
    MacBook Pro running on OSX Mountain Lion
    Arduino Uno without Atmel 328 Chip for the connection between Computer and Arduino

    This Works:
    I can upload sketches to the Colorduino, like the Plasma Code form Lincomatic:http://blog.lincomatic.com/?p=148.
    I can also start MTX control, it shows "no output device found, running in standalone mode" and I can draw Figures in the area below the text.

    When I upload the Firmware sketch(I createt a new Folder in the Librarys Folder of the Arduino Software with the files Rainbowduino.h, Rainbowduino.ccp and RCodes.h) to the Colorduino and start MTX Control, MTX Control doesn't show "no output device found, running in standalone mode" any more. When I chage the color of one dot in MTX control, the TX and RX LEDs of the Arduino Uno are blinking, but nothing changes on the Colorduino. The Buttton for saving and loading from the Device are working, too.

    I try to change the baud Rate in the Arduino sketch(#define BAUD_RATE 57600) but when i type in something other than 57600 MTX Control shows "no output device found, running in standalone mode" again.

    I don't know what I should do with the Processing Sketches, at the moment I put them all together in a folder named "mtXcontrol" and when I open the sketch "mtXcontrol.pde" with Processing, I got a window with the Code and the other .pde sketches(Button,Device,Frame,FrameChooser, GuiElement,LauchpdDevice,Matrix,Pixelcolor,ReinbowduinoDevice and mtxCotrol.java listed as tabs. When I try to "Run" the sketch with the Processing Version 2.0b7 I get this error:"No library found for themidibus
    No library found for com.rngtng.launchpad
    The processing.xml library has been replaced with a new 'XML' class that's built-in.
    This code needs to be updated for this version of Processing, please read the Changes page on the Wiki.
    " and Processing open this Page in my Browser:http://wiki.processing.org/w/Changes. And when I run it in Processing Version 1.5.1 I get this error:"
    No library found for themidibus
    No library found for com.rngtng.launchpad
    As of release 1.0, libraries must be installed in a folder named 'libraries' inside the 'sketchbook' folder."

    When I should write another Info that anyone can help me to debug, please tell me.
    When anyone has an Idea what I can try to get it work, please write a Comment or send me an E-Mail: katalytischerkonverter@googlemail.com (In Englisch or in German).
    And when you found any mistakes in my English, please don't get angry, I try my best( I normally speak German)

    Bye, thankyou for Reading, Anian

    PS to Tobi: Nice work, the programm looks very nice and I'm sure its pretty Cool when it works. Thankyou for programming!

    all based on the v2.0 build, not the 3.0 rainbowduino which I have -- and as pointed
    out by the other poster, hardware was changed between 2.0->3.0..\r\n\r\n...it
    would look like one needs to hack the v2.0  rainbowdunio .cpp/.h sources files
    (and perhaps others) in the mtxcontrol archive, to bring them into line with the
    v3.0 rainbowduino hardware, but I haven't had a close look yet ~~ needless to
    say, it's always worth asking the original author if they've done anything in
    these regards, because of their familiarity with the mtxcontrol code...so..\r\n\r\n+1

**Update:**  
_This project is a contribution for the [seeedstudio carnival 2009](http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=397) and **[won the first price!](http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=472)**_

![mtxcontrol](http://www.rngtng.com/files/2009/10/mtxcontrol.png)

**- a LED Matrix Editor -**  
**mtXcontrol** is an editor written in Processing to easily create image sequences for several output devices containing multicolor LED matrix. By now, the [Rainbowduino controller](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/rainbowduino-led-driver-platform-plug-and-shine-p-371.html) and the  
[Novation Launchpad](http://www.novationmusic.com/products/launchpad) are supported. Its generic API allows to add other in- and output devices easily.

**mtXcontrol** Editor auto detects and connects to your device. Once connected, you can draw points, lines & rows in different colors, create multiple frames and manipulate them. Add, delete, move, fill, copy & paste of frames is supported. Play all frames by different speed, realtime update the device and save your work as image file. If supported (e.g. Rainbowduino), update the sequence on your device and run it standalone. One special feature is typing letters and numbers. Future versions aim to support multiple devices, different color depth and many more.

Check out this short demo video:

<http://www.vimeo.com/6924030>

**Download mtXControl from github:**  
[Binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X](http://github.com/rngtng/mtXcontrol/downloads)  
[sources files](http://github.com/rngtng/mtXcontrol)

**Launchpad HowTo:**  
Plug your Launchpad and start mtXcontrol. The device is auto detected - start drawing and pushing buttons!!

**Rainbowudino HowTo:**  
To use your Rainbowduino with mtXcontrol you have to upload the Firmware to your rainbowduino first. [See instruction here](http://www.rngtng.com/2009/06/25/rainbowduino-here-it-is-and-how-to-program-it/). The firmware makes use of the Rainbowduino.h Library to manipulate the Matrix easily. Make sure to put it into your Arduino Library. Connect your Rainbowduino via USB to your computer, upload firmware and you are ready to go - happy mtXcontrol drawing!

[Find a detailed Step-By-Step instruction here!](http://www.seeedstudio.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=435&start=10)
